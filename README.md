Makers Academy Week 1 Challenge: The FAAST System
Using Ruby and rspec to implement TDD, we are meant to design a tube system.
The FAAST system will include stations that hold a number of trains, trains with
a number of carriages, and carriages that hold up to 40 passengers.

System is written in Ruby.
Wrote tests in a combination of London and Chicago style TDD.
Tested specs in rspec.
